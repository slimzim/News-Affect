# NEWS AFFECT

News Affect was my first group project from Vanderbilt University's Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp.  When this application was developed, the country was in lockdown due to COVID-19, and morale around the country was low.  It seemed like all news headlines were affecting us negatively.

To combat this problem, News Affect was developed.  The assignment required using two different APIs, so my group decided to use the New York Times API to pull headlines based on the user's search terms, and then send the abstracts from those articles off to a Microsoft Text Analysis API to be scored based on their likeliness of containing an overall positive sentiment.  The results are then sorted by a JavaScript function and organized accordingly in a sleek user interface.  Users are able to store their favorite headlines in the browser.
